# The 32 bytes remaining from the Natural Successor's MasterKeyRef and its successor signing public keys are used to generate the master
# private key retiring that year with HMAC-SHA-256(naturalSuccessorPubKey, message =

# XMSS SuccessorSigner picks which how many of the n-first private keys to select from based on the years until its expiration
# depending on the available promising algorithms in that year which are each assigned a key position for each year,
# XMSS for a given year uses the same seed information to generate the same Signed Successor private key for a
# given algorithm and its public key is used as the seed in moving through the tree.

# if an XMSS key is signed as a successor, user signing or device signing keys then it picks the private key based on

# SuccessorSigningKeyAddress are constructed from the HMAC(SuccessorSigningKey, message = bareJID\MasterExpYear)

# Can use SCRAM to generate pre shared key with HMAC(Hash(ClientKey), Hash(ServerKey))
